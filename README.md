### **Hey there! I'm Purbasa Bhaduri**

A freshly minted Statistics graduate with not so typical interests. I associate not with numbers alone, but with design, interfaces, and everything that makes a digital product _feel_ just right
---

### **My Unlikely Journey**

I may have studied **Statistics**, but numbers weren’t the only thing I fell in love with. Alongside data, I discovered a growing passion for:

* **Creative design**
* **UI/UX exploration**
* **Building sleek apps & websites**
* **Frontend Development**
* And bringing ideas to life through **code & interactivity**

Even though I don't come from a “tech-first” background, I’ve carved a space where **data meets design**, and I absolutely love it here.

---

### **What I Do**

I blend **analytical thinking** with **creative problem-solving** — here’s what that looks like: 
### **ANALYZE + DESIGN + BUILD + VISUALIZE** 
I dentify numbers, spot patterns, design UIs using tools like Figma & Adobe XD. Then turn mockups into live apps using frontend tech. And finally, make data speak through dashboards, plots & visual storytelling
---

### **Languages & Tools I Use**

* 💬 **Languages**: R, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* ⚙️ **Frameworks**: React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
* 🖌️ **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Canva
* 📈 **Data Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, ggplot2, Power BI, Tableau
* 🧩 **Other**: Git/GitHub, SQL, Streamlit, Shiny, APIs

---

### **Currently Working On**

* 💻 Building responsive, user-friendly websites
* 📊 Creating interactive data apps
* 🎯 Exploring the intersection of **frontend design** and **data storytelling**
* 🌱 Constantly learning new ways to build smarter, better, and cleaner

---

### ❤**Why I Do It**

Because to me, **coding is creativity**, **data is a story**, and **design is how we make people *feel***.

I believe that the best digital experiences happen when insight meets imagination — and I’m here to create just that.
