# 👋 Hey there! I'm Purbasa Bhaduri

<p style="font-size: 14px;">
A freshly minted Statistics graduate with not-so-typical interests.  
I associate not with numbers alone, but with design, interfaces, and everything that makes a digital product <em>feel</em> just right.
</p>

### ✨ My Unlikely Journey

I may have studied **Statistics**, but numbers weren’t the only thing I fell in love with. Alongside data, I discovered a growing passion for:

- 🎨 **Creative design**  
- 🧭 **UI/UX exploration**  
- 🌐 **Building sleek apps & websites**  
- 🧱 **Frontend Development**  
- 💡 And bringing ideas to life through **code & interactivity**

Even though I don't come from a “tech-first” background, I’ve carved a space where **data meets design**, and I absolutely love it here.

### 💡 What I Do

I blend **analytical thinking** with **creative problem-solving** — here’s what that looks like:

**ANALYZE + DESIGN + BUILD + VISUALIZE**

🎯 I design clean, thoughtful user interfaces using Figma & Adobe XD  
🛠️ I turn mockups into real apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React  
📊 And I visualize insights with charts, dashboards & interactive storytelling
