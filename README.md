# 👋 Hey there! I'm Purbasa Bhaduri

<p style="font-size: 14px;">
A freshly minted Statistics graduate with not-so-typical interests.  
I associate not with numbers alone, but with design, interfaces, and everything that makes a digital product <em>feel</em> just right.
</p>

### ✨ My Unlikely Journey

I may have studied **Statistics**, but numbers weren’t the only thing I fell in love with. Alongside data, I discovered a growing passion for:

-  **Creative design**  
-  **UI/UX exploration**  
-  **Building sleek apps & websites**  
-  **Frontend Development**  
- 💡 And bringing ideas to life through **code & interactivity**

Even though I don't come from a “tech-first” background, I’ve carved a space where **data meets design**, and I absolutely love it here.

### 💡 What I Do

I blend **analytical thinking** with **creative problem-solving** — here’s what that looks like:

**ANALYZE + DESIGN + BUILD + VISUALIZE**

<p style="font-size: 14px;">
 I break down data to find meaning  
 I design clean, thoughtful user interfaces using Figma & Adobe XD  
 I turn mockups into real apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React  
 And I visualize insights with charts, dashboards & interactive storytelling
</p>

-  **Languages**:        R, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### 🚀 Currently Working On

### ❤️ Why I Do It

Because to me, **coding is creativity**, **data is a story**, and **design is how we make people *feel*.**

I believe the best digital experiences happen when **insight meets imagination** — and I’m here to create just that.
